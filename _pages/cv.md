Work experience
======
* **Audio Data Scientist I** - Itaú Unibanco (March 2021 - Present)
    * As an audio data scientist in Itaú, I am mainly focused on the development and deployment of audio machine learning models applying MLOps techniques.
    * Tech/knowledge applied: AWS, Audio Signal Processing, Deep Learning, Python, REST APIs.

* **Thesis Research Co-advisor** (August 2021 - Present)
    * Co-advising a bachelor thesis that aims to provide MRI reconstruction with deep learning techniques.
  
* **Data Scientist** - Bank of Brazil (March 2020 - September 2020)
    * At Banco do Brasil, I was responsible for developing and presenting client-focused analytics projects. These projects include: Exploratory Data Analysis, Insights Reports, client-focused Machine Learning Models for Classification, Regression, Clustering, and ETL pipelines.
    * Tech used: Python, SQL, H2O AutoML, Matplotlib, Plotly, XGBoost, Sklearn, SAS, IBM DB2.

* **Data Scientist** - Vert (April 2019 - July 2019)
    * Responsible for the development of a dashboard with Brazilian national traffic infographics at the National Land Transportation Agency (ANTT). Most of the time querying, parsing, transforming, and displaying data in dashboards using SAS Viya.
    * Tech used: SAS Viya, SQL, Python, Sklearn, Matplotlib.

* **NLP Machine Learning Researcher & Engineer** - AI Lab (February 2018 - April 2019)
    * Responsible for the model behind VICTOR, the biggest AI project in the Brazilian Judiciary (2019). Developed an ETL pipeline to extract text data from PDFs (both digital and images), extract text with pdftotext or OCR, and ingest into the database. Exploratory Data Analysis to leverage insight from the legal documents. Analyse crucial features, feature engineering, and feature scaling. Developed an extremely multiclass and multilabel NLP model for lawsuit general repercussion theme classification with an F1 score of over 80% with over 30 labels and over 5 simultaneous labels for some documents. Published two international papers on text classification with NLP techniques.
    * Tech used: Python, TFIDF, OneVsRest, Word2Vec, NLTK, Gensim, Spacy, Keras, XGBoost, CNNs, LSTMs, Sklearn, Pandas, Plotly, Matplotlib, Docker, Git, CUDA, RabbiqMQ, PyPDF, multiple OCR engines, PostgreSQL.

* **Data Science Researcher** - AI Lab (August 2017 - February 2018)
    * Proof of concept of a system capable of identifying plantation in a given area using satellite imagery.
    * Tech researched: Image Processing, Computer Vision, Deep Learning.
