## Experiences

### Python Engineer @ [Turing.com](https://www.turing.com/)

_August 2022 - Present, California, Remote_

Python developer for one of the biggest AI research companies.

### Machine Learning Engineer @ [Itaú Unibanco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ita%C3%BA_Unibanco)

_March 2021 - August 2022, São Paulo, Remote_

Responsible for developing, deploying and monitoring audio deep learning models following MLOps practices.
* I am one of the lead organisers for the Itaú Data Science Meetup, helping the community grow by +1500 subscribers since I joined. (YouTube)
* Improved the speaker verification model by ~20 percentage points in EER on noisy datasets.
* Improved the speaker diarization model by ~30 percentage points in DER on noisy datasets.
* I designed and developed an _end-to-end automatic speech recognition_ system that involved five different Deep Learning models creating a structured output for each audio file received in a database with a message queuing system. The architecture was composed of 10+ AWS IaC services varying from S3, Lambdas, SQS, SNS, and ECS Fargate, among others.
