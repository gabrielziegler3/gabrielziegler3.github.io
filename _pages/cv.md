## Summary

I am a Machine Learning Engineer with 4 years of experience in Data Science and with a strong Software Engineering background starting a master‚Äôs degree in Data Science at the Eindhoven University of Technology. I have worked in NLP, Fraud Detection, CRM, Computer Vision, MRI and Speech Processing as well as Systems Design. I also love studying data structures and design patterns.

## Experiences

### Machine Learning Engineer at Ita√∫ Unibanco
_March 2021 - Present, Remote_

Responsible for developing, deploying and monitoring audio deep learning models following MLOps practices.
* I am one of the lead organisers for the Ita√∫ Data Science Meetup, helping the community grow by +1500 subscribers since I joined. (YouTube) 
* Improved the speaker verification model by ~20 percentage points in EER on noisy datasets.
* Improved the speaker diarization model by ~30 percentage points in DER on noisy datasets.
* I designed and developed an end-to-end automatic speech recognition system that involved five different Deep Learning models creating a structured output for each audio file received in a database with a message queuing system. The architecture was composed of 10+ AWS IaC services varying from S3, Lambdas, SQS, SNS, and ECS Fargate, among others.

Tech: **API Gateway, IAM, KMS, ECS, EFS, CodeBuild, CodePipeline, CloudWatch, Fargate, Lambda, Sagemaker,  SQS, SNS, S3, Python, Pytorch, Hugging Face Transformers, Docker, Flask, Linux.**

### Data Scientist at Banco do Brasil 
March 2020 - September 2020, Remote

Responsible for ETL pipelines, EDA, Insights Reports and client-focused Machine Learning Models for Classification, Regression, and Clustering.
* Improved the credit limit model by 10 percentage points in F1-Score.

Tech used: **Python, SQL, H2O AutoML, SAS, IBM DB2.**

### Data Scientist at Vert
