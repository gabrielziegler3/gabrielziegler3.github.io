title: "Context-Dependent Probabilistic Prior Information Strategy for MRI Reconstruction"
excerpt: "Context-Dependent Probabilistic Prior Information (CoDePPI), is a better prior information extraction algorithm for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reconstructions with the use of the Compressed Sensing (CS) theory. Our
method CoDePPI takes advantage of motion information across frames in a dynamic
MRI to weigh the confidence that the extracted positions are effectively part of a support structure, that is, reducing the noise introduced by applying prior information."
