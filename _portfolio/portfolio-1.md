title: "Context-Dependent Probabilistic Prior Information Strategy for MRI Reconstruction"
excerpt: "In this thesis, we introduce Context-Dependent Probabilistic Prior Information
(CoDePPI), the best prior information extraction algorithm for Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) reconstructions with the use of the Compressed Sensing (CS) theory. Our
method CoDePPI takes advantage of motion information across frames in a dynamic
MRI to weigh the confidence that the extracted positions are effectively part of a
support structure, that is, reducing the noise introduced by applying prior information.
Our method achieves the highest reconstruction quality when compared to other prior
information strategies and also is faster to compute than classical prior information
due to its implementation that lacks the need to perform array elements positions
lookup. In our experiments, our approach provides better reconstruction in terms of the
evaluated metrics: Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR),
Structural SIMilarity (SSIM), Normalized Mean Squared Error (NMSE), Mean Squared
Error (MSE).
Achieving higher quality with a reduced number of samples allows faster exam
procedures, making MRI cheaper, faster, and more convenient for both patients and
clinics, which is our ultimate goal.
