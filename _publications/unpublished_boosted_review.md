# Abstract

Shallow decision trees are weak classifiers that can
be combined to create a robust predictive model. Ensemble
methods have benefits over a simple decision tree like reducing
bias, over-fitting and accuracy improvement. This study has the
purpose to study the state-of-art of boosting trees techniques
and its applications and analyse qualitatively what has been
published on boosting methods. We have searched on IEEE,
Scopus, ACM and Elsevier repositories with a string derived
from technique PICO. We found a total of 102 papers, and
after applying our criteria we got 47 papers. We summarized
the methods of gradient boosting decision trees for classification
and regression problems. We analysed the algorithms XGBoost,
LightGBM, CatBoost, LambdaMART in different published
scenarios. We have classified the found papers in the subcategories: business, new method, civil engineering, network
security, health, model improvement. We conclude that boosted
tree-based algorithms is a field of research in exploration, and
development of new techniques.
