title: "Document type classification for Brazilâ€™s supreme court using a Convolutional Neural Network"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2018_ICOFCS_CNN_document_classification.md
excerpt: 'The Brazilian Court System is currently the biggest judiciary system in the world, and receives an extremely high number of lawsuit cases every day. These cases need to be analyzed in order to be associated to relevant tags and allocated to the right team. Most of the cases reach the court as single PDF files containing multiple documents. One of the first steps for the analysis is to classify these documents. In this paper we present results on identifying these pieces of document using a simple convolutional neural network.'
